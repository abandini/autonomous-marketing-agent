2. **Task Scheduler** handles the timing and execution of tasks, ensuring they run at the appropriate times and with the correct resources.

3. **Event Manager** enables components to communicate through events, creating a loosely coupled, reactive system that can respond to changes in real-time.

4. **Recovery Manager** monitors the health of all components and implements recovery strategies when failures occur, ensuring the system remains operational.

#### Usage Example

```python
# Initialize components
task_scheduler = TaskScheduler(config.get('task_scheduler', {}))
event_manager = EventManager(config.get('event_manager', {}))
recovery_manager = RecoveryManager(config.get('recovery_manager', {}))

# Create the ProcessOrchestrator with the components
orchestrator = ProcessOrchestrator(
    config=config,
    task_scheduler=task_scheduler,
    event_manager=event_manager,
    recovery_manager=recovery_manager
)

# Start the orchestrator
await orchestrator.start()

# Schedule a website update process
update_process = await orchestrator.schedule_website_update(
    repository_name='marketing-website',
    schedule_type='once',
    schedule_value=datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1)
)
```
